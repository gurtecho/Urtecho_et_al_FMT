Scripts and datasets necessary to generate figures in manuscript titled, "Spatiotemporal dynamics during niche remodeling by super-colonizing microbiota in the mammalian gut"

Major directories are as follows:

'experiments' - Contains Processed datasets which are analyzed
'figs' - Raw figures and directories where figures are exported to from scripts files
'scripts' - Scripts used to generate all figures from processed datasets in experiments. In some cases (I.e. MICOM, BA analysis) separate directories were made for analysis and figure generation, which can be found in the 'experiments' directory.

Raw data files can be found on SRA, Bioproject PRJNA1028308
